# One Shot Facial Recognition Using Siamese Networks

## Overview

This project is an implementation of facial recognition using a **Siamese Neural Network (SNN)**, inspired by a research paper on one-shot learning for face verification. The model is designed to distinguish between different individuals by comparing facial embeddings rather than traditional classification methods.

## Features

- **Siamese Network Architecture**: Utilizes twin neural networks to compute similarity scores between images.
- **TensorFlow & Keras Implementation**: Built using TensorFlow for deep learning capabilities.
- **Facial Image Preprocessing**: Includes normalization, augmentation, and resizing.
- **Contrastive Loss Function**: Measures the distance between facial embeddings for verification.
- **High Accuracy on Limited Data**: Leverages one-shot learning principles to recognize faces with minimal training data.

## Dataset & Preprocessing

The model was trained on a dataset containing labeled facial images. Preprocessing steps include:

- Grayscale conversion and normalization
- Image resizing to a fixed input shape
- Data augmentation (optional)
- Pairing of images for training the Siamese network

## Model Architecture

The Siamese Network consists of:

1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for feature extraction
2. **Shared Weights** across twin networks
3. **Euclidean Distance Calculation** to measure similarity
4. **Sigmoid Activation** for binary classification (same/different)

## Training & Evaluation

- **Loss Function**: Contrastive loss
- **Optimizer**: Adam
- **Metrics**: Accuracy and distance-based thresholding
- **Validation**: Tested on unseen images to evaluate generalization

## Installation

Seeing as I only shared the notebook I don't know yet but feel free to clone and 
then apply the code to your own images  or dataser or whatever. 



##Resources used include 
The labelled faces in the wild dataset. 
tensorflow and keras of course 
And a jupyter notebook in a VS code environment. 

## Future Improvements

- Fine-tuning with a larger dataset
- Implementing triplet loss for improved feature learning
- Deploying as a web service using Flask or FastAPI
- Export and use in another independent applicationÂ
